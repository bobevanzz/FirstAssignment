Why am I taking this bootvamp?
I am taking this bootcamp because I think Technology and evolution go hand in hand. We as a society are sorely dependant on it and this leaves more jobs and opportunities in the field as opposed to flipping burgers.

What is the more important thing for me to learn?
The most important thing for me to learn is the realization that it's impossible to be a know it all in this field. Patience and the want to thrive.

What do I want to do after the bootcamp?
Obviously start out as a full stack developer, then onto making applications, possibly video games in unreal or unity, and maybe even learn block chain technology.
